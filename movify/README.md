# 🎬 Movify — React Movie Search App

Movify is a modern and responsive movie search app built with **React** using the **TMDB (The Movie Database) API**. It allows users to search for movies by name and view details like release date, rating, and overview. The app provides a smooth UX using features like skeleton loading, a "no results" fallback UI, and React best practices.
